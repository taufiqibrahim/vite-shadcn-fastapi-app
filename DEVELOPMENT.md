# Development Strategy and Workflow

This document outlines the Git branching and tagging strategy we will use for our project to support different release types (bare-minimum, bare-minimum + feature ABC, bare-minimum + demo) and differentiated deployment pipelines.

## 1. Branching Strategy: Gitflow (Simplified)

We will primarily use a simplified version of the Gitflow workflow:

* **`main`:** This branch will always reflect the production-ready state. Every commit on `main` that represents a deployable release will be tagged.
* **`develop`:** This is the integration branch for all ongoing development. Feature branches are merged into `develop`.
* **`feature/*`:** Short-lived branches created from `develop` to develop specific features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/payment-gateway`). Once a feature is complete and tested, it's merged back into `develop`.
* **`release/*`:** Short-lived branches created from `develop` when preparing for a new release. This allows for final bug fixes and metadata adjustments before merging into `main` and tagging.
* **`hotfix/*`:** Short-lived branches created from `main` to address critical bugs in production. Once fixed, they are merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

## 2. Tagging Strategy: Semantic Versioning with Release Context

We will use Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) as the base for our tags and append suffixes to indicate the release context:

* **Bare-minimum release:** `v1.0.0` (Standard SemVer for the initial core functionality)
* **Bare-minimum + feature ABC release:** `v1.1.0-abc` (Minor increment indicating a new feature, with `-abc` suffix)
* **Bare-minimum + demo release:** `v1.0.0-demo` (Patch or Minor increment depending on changes, with `-demo` suffix for demo-specific features)

**Examples:**

* Initial bare-minimum release: `v1.0.0`
* Bug fix on the bare-minimum release: `v1.0.1`
* Bare-minimum with demo features: `v1.1.0-demo`
* Bare-minimum with "reporting" feature: `v1.2.0-reporting`

## 3. Workflow and Examples

### 3.1. Starting a New Feature (e.g., User Authentication)

1.  Ensure your `develop` branch is up-to-date:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    ```
2.  Create a new feature branch from `develop`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
    ```
3.  Develop the user authentication feature, making commits as needed:
    ```bash
    # ... implement user authentication ...
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement user authentication logic"
    git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
    ```
4.  Once the feature is complete and tested, merge it back into `develop` via a Pull Request (PR). After the PR is reviewed and approved:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge --no-ff feature/user-authentication
    git branch -d feature/user-authentication
    git push origin develop
    git push origin --delete feature/user-authentication
    ```

### 3.2. Preparing and Tagging a Bare-Minimum Release (v1.0.0)

1.  Ensure `develop` is in a state ready for the bare-minimum release:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    ```
2.  Create a release branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b release/1.0.0
    ```
3.  Perform any final checks, update version numbers, etc., on the release branch.
    ```bash
    git commit -am "Prepare release 1.0.0"
    ```
4.  Merge the release branch into `main` and tag it:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Bare-minimum release v1.0.0"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```
5.  Merge the release branch back into `develop`:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
    git branch -d release/1.0.0
    git push origin develop
    git push origin --delete release/1.0.0
    ```

### 3.3. Preparing and Tagging a Release with Feature ABC (v1.1.0-abc)

Let's say "feature ABC" in our imaginary scenario is "Product Catalog V2". This feature has already been developed and merged into `develop`.

1.  Ensure `develop` contains the "Product Catalog V2" feature:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    ```
2.  Create a release branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b release/1.1.0-abc
    ```
3.  Perform any final checks specific to this release.
    ```bash
    git commit -am "Prepare release 1.1.0 with Product Catalog V2"
    ```
4.  Merge into `main` and tag:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge --no-ff release/1.1.0-abc
    git tag -a v1.1.0-abc -m "Release v1.1.0 with core features and Product Catalog V2"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```
5.  Merge back into `develop`:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge --no-ff release/1.1.0-abc
    git branch -d release/1.1.0-abc
    git push origin develop
    git push origin --delete release/1.1.0-abc
    ```

### 3.4. Preparing and Tagging a Demo Release (v1.0.0-demo)

Let's say our "demo" includes a specific set of features for showcasing, like pre-populated data and a guided tour. These features would have been developed in `feature/demo-data` and `feature/guided-tour` and merged into `develop`.

1.  Ensure `develop` contains the demo-specific features:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    ```
2.  Create a release branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b release/1.0.0-demo
    ```
3.  Perform any demo-specific adjustments or configurations.
    ```bash
    git commit -am "Prepare demo release with pre-populated data and guided tour"
    ```
4.  Merge into `main` and tag:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0-demo
    git tag -a v1.0.0-demo -m "Demo release with core features, pre-populated data, and guided tour"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```
5.  Merge back into `develop`:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0-demo
    git branch -d release/1.0.0-demo
    git push origin develop
    git push origin --delete release/1.0.0-demo
    ```

### 3.5. Hotfix for a Production Issue (e.g., on v1.0.0)

1.  Identify the tag of the production release you need to fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout v1.0.0
    ```
2.  Create a hotfix branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login-bug
    ```
3.  Implement the fix:
    ```bash
    # ... fix the login bug ...
    git add .
    git commit -am "Fix critical login bug"
    ```
4.  Merge the hotfix into `main` and tag a new patch release:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge --no-ff hotfix/fix-login-bug
    git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Fix critical login bug in v1.0.0"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```
5.  Merge the hotfix back into `develop`:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge --no-ff hotfix/fix-login-bug
    git branch -d hotfix/fix-login-bug
    git push origin develop
    git push origin --delete hotfix/fix-login-bug
    ```

## 4. Differentiating Pipelines per Release

Our CI/CD system will be configured to differentiate pipelines based on the Git branch and, more importantly, the tags created on the `main` branch.

* **Triggers:** Pipelines will be triggered by pushes to `develop`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` branches, and the creation of tags on the `main` branch.
* **Pipeline Logic:**
    * **Pushes to `develop`:** Run unit tests, integration tests, static code analysis, and potentially deploy to a development environment.
    * **Pushes to `release/*`:** Run more comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests, build release artifacts.
    * **Pushes to `hotfix/*`:** Run targeted tests to verify the fix and build a hotfix release artifact.
    * **Tag creation on `main` (e.g., `v1.0.0`):** Trigger the production deployment pipeline for the bare-minimum release. This pipeline will likely involve more rigorous checks, security scans, and deployment to the production environment.
    * **Tag creation on `main` (e.g., `v1.1.0-abc`):** Trigger a specific production deployment pipeline for the release including "feature ABC". This might involve deploying specific configurations or enabling feature flags related to ABC.
    * **Tag creation on `main` (e.g., `v1.0.0-demo`):** Trigger a deployment pipeline to a dedicated demo environment with the necessary demo configurations and data.

The CI/CD configuration will need to inspect the Git ref (branch or tag name) to determine which steps to execute and which environment to deploy to. Regular expressions or string matching on the tag name will be used to identify the release type.

## 5. Team Guidelines

* Always create feature branches from the latest `develop`.
* Merge features into `develop` via Pull Requests for code review.
* Release branches should be short-lived and only used for final release preparation.
* Tag releases on the `main` branch following the specified semantic versioning with context suffixes.
* Hotfix branches should be created from the specific production tag that needs fixing.
* Ensure your local repository is always synchronized with the remote repository (`git pull`).
* Communicate clearly about upcoming releases and the features they include.

By adhering to this development strategy, we can effectively manage different release streams and ensure a clear and consistent deployment process for our project.
